# LocalChat

LocalChat is a direct chat tool, which may be run to communicate over a local network.

![Gif of the application GUI](https://github.com/rbaltrusch/LocalChat/blob/master/src/gui/media/gif1.gif?raw=true "Gif of the application GUI")

Communication happens over the localhost port 8080.

This is primarily an exercise in duplex client-server communication using websockets.
